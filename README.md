# Football-Booking-Ticket-React-Native

## Getting Started

To run this project, please follow these steps:

Install dev dependencies, because there was a compatibility issue in @n1ru4l/react-in-center-of-screen package, you may not use default `npm install` command, instead:

### `npm install ----legacy-peer-deps`

## Then

Run The app

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `npm run android` or `yarn run android`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
